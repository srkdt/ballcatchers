# ballcatchers

## Abstract

As part of the Mechatronics Trinational curriculum, our team has developed a reaction-based ball catching game as 5th semester project. The device consists of a main station retaining two magnetically connected balls, which are realeased at a random interval. As the user lifts his hands from the station to catch the balls, a timer starts and stops when the balls is caught. This reaction time is then displayed to the user. ESP32s are used for data processing as well as communicating between the station and the balls.
